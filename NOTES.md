# De Voorhoede Progressive Web App

## Native share
Use `navigator.share()` to natively give all share options available on mobile devices. On desktops it's supported by Safari only.

## Install to Homescreen
On iOS, it is never possible, on any browser, to prompt the user, like on Android. This is a feature of iOS. Non Safari browsers will still use the Safari engine, so even Chrome won't install.

## Windows 10 Apps
A PWA can be submitted to the Windows 10 Apps.

## PWA Stats
Lots of info about making the case to convince managers we should switch to a Progressive Web App:

Also see Pinterest case study for Progressive web Apps.

## Server side templates
In the code of De Voorhoede, the html pages are server-side templates, but that isn't relevant to PWA which is 100% client-side.
