# Runtime caching

## Exercise

In your [service worker](src/service-worker.js):

- Add runtime caching for images. See e.g. [cache only strategy](https://serviceworke.rs/strategy-cache-only.html) in the Service Worker Cookbook.
- Add runtime caching for HTML pages. See [Service Worker Cookbook](https://serviceworke.rs/) for example caching strategies.
- Add runtime caching for messages API requests. See e.g. the [cache and update strategy](https://serviceworke.rs/strategy-cache-and-update.html)in the Service Worker Cookbook.
